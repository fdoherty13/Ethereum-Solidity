# Ethereum-Solidity
Hosted Election

Ethereum is more than just a cryptocurrency, Ethereum is a living, breathing, virtual machince; one that can run and deploy smart contracts. Smart contracts, are executable packets of code that live inside this virtual machine until called upon or referenced through others. In this simple contract, I show how one can build a ballot-like election to live within active voters' network. This is achieved by exploiting the double-spending problem. If you don't know, the double-spending problem is what Bitcoin famously first solved, utilizing a blockchain (consistent hashing) this machine prevents users (voters) from using a singular file (or vote) twice in an instance.
